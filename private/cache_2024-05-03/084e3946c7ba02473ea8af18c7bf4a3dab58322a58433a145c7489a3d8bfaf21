2022-04-17T04:43:09Z	It's official, [yarnpods](https://yarn.yarnpods.com) is officially coming off of apache2 because I've completely fucked the reverse proxying 😂 Now the question is, is Nginx of Traefik easier to learn?
2022-04-17T04:45:22Z	(#th6zxhq) This will also give me the opportunity to setup the docker-compose file to include yarnd as well as Gitea.
2022-04-17T04:56:26Z	(#th6zxhq) Nevermind, decided Traefik would fit best as I don't necessarily need a web server on my server, this can be handled inside docker.
2022-04-17T09:05:45Z	(#th6zxhq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'll definitely take a look!  @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> I'm hoping with Traefik it's only a few things to do in config for the reverse proxy to Docker containers 😂 Apache unfortunately is a bit...dated  Got Traefik working for port 80 and the dashboard on 8080 for now. Will continue this after the little one is in bed
2022-04-17T12:31:17Z	(#th6zxhq) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> I'm right there with you!  @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic> So, I'm guessing a config file may be an easier way to manage all of these?
2022-04-17T13:55:03Z	(#th6zxhq) I think I'm going to need a course on how to correctly define services, routers and just everything Traefik. This is making my brain implode 😅
2022-06-08T09:13:09Z	(#wfgf5da) @<carsten http://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> I'm still alive! Yes, I did just move across Australia so I'm still out of action on the migration over to traefik, which hasn't been hugely fun 😂
2022-06-13T23:58:24Z	Anyone have any no/low cost cloud providers I can run my Yarn instance on? Thinking it may be a good idea to host it in the cloud rather than on my own hardware, and yes, I would prefer a provider with a good privacy policy.
2022-06-14T00:27:15Z	(#zjsrxoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'll check it out! Sucks they require a credit card linked if you don't want to make a payment 😬
2022-06-17T09:16:22Z	(#zjsrxoa) @<retrocrash https://twtxt.net/user/retrocrash/twtxt.txt> It was running, but there's no bridge to the internet and it's not updating from the data file. I figure it's better to have a somewhat standard configuration than a unique one.
2022-06-30T04:11:28Z	Haven't been around lately. Here's a photo from the glass elevators at work 😊   ![](https://twtxt.net/media/R2MYQ3pjMaa62mM7oxugYA.png)
2022-07-06T01:49:06Z	(#omsxfeq) @<carsten http://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> Close! It's 111 Eagle Street. Photo from level 50
2022-07-06T02:33:08Z	(#omsxfeq) @<ionores https://twtxt.net/user/ionores/twtxt.txt> Not a chance! 😂 I work to work (an hour+ of walking everyday I'm in the city) and my legs are already pooped by the time I get home 😅
2022-07-06T03:00:35Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think this is almost done. Just 1 more responsive size to go (801px-1200px primarily for any size between mobile and desktop but will add more if required).   ![](https://twtxt.net/media/tHTUFzZ3eVb7Ux87dHeC53.png)
2022-07-06T13:06:50Z	(#7ejbduq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I did cave and use XAMPP because I'm just not sharp enough to get zs working, however I have put it in the relevant zs files and linked it to the CSS directory, so it should be very easy to just chuck into a zs environment and work 😁
2022-07-06T13:08:22Z	(#7ejbduq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Also, sorry for it taking so long. I should've had this finished way earlier but moving got in the way a lot 😅
2022-07-07T12:14:08Z	(#3nr4ekq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> 🥳 congrats! Now to register an account 😉
2022-07-08T03:26:56Z	(#7ejbduq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> This should be good to go now. I'll pop it up on gitea for you tonight. I'm also happy to continue on with further development and fixes as needed/wanted 😊
2022-07-09T02:31:49Z	(#7ejbduq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> https://git.mills.io/Screem/yarn-docs 😊 I feel as more pages are made and more markdown is used, I may need to make changes on the fly. Hopefully this won't need to happen too often. Plus, depending on the structure of the .md files, will need to update the links to direct.
2022-07-13T05:48:21Z	(#x3kam3q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Big agree! Microtransactions are eating away at the gaming industry because they have no incentive to make good and innovative games anymore (especially Activision Blizzard with the WoW expansions being lack luster and the same Call of Duty product pushed every year. Don't get me.started on Diablo Immortal). If BMW is successful with microtransactions, I'll be pretty worried about the future of the automotive industry.
2022-07-13T06:06:13Z	(#v6ksn2q) @<win0err https://kolesnikov.se/twtxt.txt> I agree with @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> about the text size. Adding `content="width=device-width"` to your viewport meta tag will help massively with scaling on different device widths.  Eg. The first screenshot is the current site with a device width of 440px and the second is with the updated viewport meta tag.   ![](https://twtxt.net/media/GYHVdrVJos792QiKuUNLgT.png)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/u5NsxbZdW4vYBZrKQZDXhU.png)  Other than that, I like the aesthetic of it 😊 It gives me early-ish internet vibes, which I wasn't online for (I'm a '90s baby) but I've seen some pretty early websites.
2022-07-14T05:05:24Z	(#aip2mnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I like the Windows 11 UX 🤐
2022-07-14T05:07:09Z	(#x3kam3q) @<retrocrash https://twtxt.net/user/retrocrash/twtxt.txt> Yes sir! 🤪 Can't wait for a subscription fee for oxygen.
2022-07-14T08:57:21Z	(#zjsrxoa) I've decided on Vultr for the time being. Thank you for your suggestions! Might give GCS a try at some point as well for other misc. things to see how that goes.  Now to try and work out how installing this works 🤔
2022-07-14T08:58:38Z	(#aip2mnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I like that they went for a design that hasn't been present on Windows, even though it is more than likely "inspired by" MacOS.
2022-07-14T09:14:53Z	New phone buying season is almost here. The question is get an iPhone to change it up a bit or wait for the Samsung Galaxy Fold4 late this year?! 🤔
2022-07-17T13:13:46Z	(#2o73x6q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> See, I feel that example isn't the best as it has the main features a general user could want in a much smaller, nicer looking and easier to navigate right-click menu. Sure, these things can be annoying in the moment but tbh I'm not really going to let me UX get ruined because of an extra click or two.  I do agree that changing default browsers is a tad on the cumbersome side, however I can see instances someone may _want_ to use different browsers for different tasks. Not trying to say this is a usual user activity or that it isn't annoying, but I don't agree with the narrative of Microsoft trying to make things harder to do to keep you in their ecosystem, especially as law makers in the US are a bit more (albeit negligibly so) aware of anti-consumer and anti-competition practices that have been implemented in the industry (eg. EU's requirement for all phones to be USB-C compatible to stop Apple forcing their users to buy a new, over-priced cable if they were to damage the original one)
2022-07-18T09:04:20Z	(#evw75qq) @<retrocrash https://twtxt.net/user/retrocrash/twtxt.txt> Pixels have never interested me tbh, mostly due to the first one being far behind the competition for a flagship smart phone. I'll have a look at grapheneos 😊
2022-07-19T07:29:38Z	(#2o73x6q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I agree with your points and did see that video, however I don't agree with the narrative that Microsoft is making these decision maliciously. If they were making those sorts of decisions to keep you locked into Microsoft only, they wouldn't have redesigned the UI to be slightly more annoying (I barely use the right-click menu daily) and they'd still be soldering on through Windows on mobile and not using Android (cool idea but the ecosystem of apps is lacking and the design was....yeah, it existed for sure).  I personally believe Microsoft knows what they're unable to take much market share from companies, such as Google, and are focusing their main efforts into the future of gaming with their cloud gaming services (they function really well) and gamepass. Maybe I'm being naive; if so, I'll gladly admit I was wrong.
2022-07-19T07:38:34Z	(#evw75qq) @<retrocrash https://twtxt.net/user/retrocrash/twtxt.txt> That's fair. I'm very much a fan of lots of features 😆  @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I've settled on waiting for the iPhone 14 and get the Pro Max. Same with my partner. Just means I'll have to get the AirPods Max as well for a wireless headset. I know, tough life sometimes 🤣
2022-07-19T08:57:23Z	I've been brushing up on some ethical hacking skills lately. Hoping to carry this through to other CTF style activities.   ![](https://twtxt.net/media/n2rtcXQSC62jVvvaPgbR6A.png)
2022-07-25T09:44:20Z	Well, well, well. Look what we have here. Will this make you want to stop using Go now @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>?? 🤔 🤣 (I suspect not)   ![](https://twtxt.net/media/cvkRJurJVp2CKBjnEauTEW.png)
2022-07-25T09:47:24Z	(#yjqj5qa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Oof. Lots of nasty stuff going around (just got over some flu going around, not the real bad one luckily). Hope it's nothing too serious for you!
2022-07-25T13:53:44Z	(#ofvz6ia) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> But...our Google overlords will be very disappointed 🤣
2022-07-26T01:02:54Z	With the uptick in ads being shown on platforms like Twitter, I'd like to petition a name change of these platforms from "social media" to "social marketing". Seems to fit well, I think 🤔 😂
2022-07-28T04:50:21Z	Is this overkill for spreadsheets and word documents? 🤔    ![](https://twtxt.net/media/rETdxNj5euT86aFUHkgcUk.png)   This arrived today! Samsung Odyssey G9 49" 240hz Curved Monitor 😊  The laptop is a 15" HP Dragonfly Elitebook
2022-08-01T00:21:18Z	(#ckybfdq) All of your replies are amazing 🤣  @<retrocrash https://twtxt.net/user/retrocrash/twtxt.txt> Thanks! The keyboard is 60% (no directional buttons unless I use the Fn key)  The pay for the new gig isn't anything amazing, I assure you 🤣 been wanting this monitor, or similar, for a good while now though. On another note, I've been told I'm one of the top 3 people in my position or in a senior consultant position, so that's a huge plus!  @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Nobody _needs_ this much real estate 😆 it just replaced my 3x 27" monitors, which was the goal. More desk space to work with and dump my snacks 😉
2022-08-01T04:10:41Z	(#skoqxea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> 🙋‍♂️ I may have a couple of RPis
2022-08-01T07:38:34Z	(#skoqxea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Will have time tonight around 8.30-9 :)
2022-08-03T06:04:22Z	(#objsowa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Very nice graphic. I wonder who owns that one offline Pod 🤔🤣
2022-08-03T06:09:02Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I may need your help with this whole Vultr `yarnd` install, if you have time over the next few days. Work has picked up again so won't have time during the day 🤣
2022-08-03T09:41:27Z	(#zwvw6aq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Sounds like a plan! See you then! 😊
2022-08-06T05:39:31Z	Was only a matter of time before the next Twitter breach.  https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/twitter-breach-exposed-anonymous-account-owners-88013236
2022-08-06T05:41:41Z	(#d6xttgq) The part that surprises me is their advice to people running accounts that are supposed to not show their identity is pretty baffling. "Don't use a publicly known email or phone number" seems like a but of a "victim blame" for Twitter accepting risk that has now exposed the information of millions of accounts.
2022-09-19T05:31:07Z	Since it’s official, I’m now permanent in my role at work! My probation ended early due to the quality of work and willingness to do anything I’ve been tasked with 🥳
2022-09-19T06:06:49Z	(#hjpwlnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thanks! A lot of stress off our minds. Now we’re here to stay in Brisbane for a while 😏
2022-09-19T06:08:51Z	(#moklqra) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> huh, this looks super intriguing to me. I’d be happy to test this out, so I can sandbox some things on my Rpi (been slacking on that a bit 😅)
2022-09-20T02:13:57Z	(#hjpwlnq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> Thank you! Now to catch up on a bit of a knowledge gap! I’m undertaking my CISSP soon, curtesy of work 😉
2022-09-21T05:29:41Z	(#hhdseja) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  Wow! You really have one hell of a representative in your area. She’s a shining example of what most should be. It’s a similar internet situation in WA, where I was FTTN with 3KMs of copper and paying for 100MBps. I truely feel your pain 😔
2022-09-26T21:32:12Z	For my fellow Australians, I hope none of you use Optus for any ISP services 😬
2022-09-26T21:35:39Z	(#rfs6lza) If so, keep an eye out on [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) over the coming days. 10,000 records are being released for the next 4 days until Optus pays the extortion fee. I don’t think this is likely considering they’ve already engaged the AFP (Australian Federal Police).
2022-09-26T21:38:52Z	(#rfs6lza) For those abroad who aren’t familiar with this, Optus (an ISP) has suffered a data breach. Data that has been exposed are: full name, date of birth, address and potentially government documents such as driver’s licence, passport and Medicare number (public health care number). There’s evidence of 55 Medicare numbers being exposed in the first batch of 10,000 records that have been released today.
2022-09-26T22:20:34Z	(#rfs6lza) It’s rumoured that the attacker(s) were able to access an API that linked to a test environment that didn’t require authentication. This environment had access to Optus’ production customer databases.
2022-09-27T04:16:41Z	(#rfs6lza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  I’ve been learning very fast that mostly investing further money into the already barebones budget IT/Security is usually seen as a poor Return On Investment. I’m sure you know from your Facebook days, but even AU companies would rather pay massive fines every 5-10 years than focusing on security. I think part of the issue is the high prices currently put on security solutions but a huge component is compliance > competence.
2022-09-27T04:17:25Z	(#rfs6lza)  also very telling that the old CISO left Optus 3 weeks prior to the breach. Sounds like some very shitty decisions from the top.
2022-09-27T06:41:29Z	Interesting and tough moral dilemma: is it appropriate for Government to strip privacy away from all citizens in favour for the safety of children online to avoid the production and distribution of CSAM? I ask because there’s a podcast from the Australian Federal Police around CSAM in Australia and there was a statement that effectively the prevention of CSAM needs to take a priority over privacy.
2022-09-27T06:42:54Z	(#zdoe7hq) Persoanlly, I of course want CSAM to be reduced to the point of becoming non-existent, however I do hold the right to privacy, whether exercised or not, very high on my priority list these days. It’s a tough dilemma for me, that’s for sure 🤔
2022-09-27T07:03:12Z	(#zdoe7hq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> that’s a fair point. My thinking is really geared towards children that don’t have parents that care what happens to them, which is also an entirely different root cause. I’m still swayed in the same direction as you though
2022-09-27T07:07:01Z	(#zdoe7hq) Also brings up the old point of if they take away our privacy, what else would they be willing to take from us. Seems like a net negative all around to punish the majority over the actions of the minority
2022-09-27T08:11:46Z	(#zdoe7hq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I think that’s a fair assessment. Apart from the very top level, I feel there are a lot of good people with a lot of good intentions. I do agree that it will inevitably cross the line but it’ll be the kind of thing where a lot of politicians probably won’t care because they won’t be alive long enough to see extreme abuse of their policies and laws, which we already see with climate change inaction from the Australian Liberal Party.
2022-09-27T08:16:36Z	(#vfxgqmq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> this is my main issue with a lot of applications of cryptocurrency. This would work just as well with traditional payment methods. I feel a lot of these applications are in effect to just avoid taxes, launder money or wash dirty money. Happy to be proven wrong
2022-09-27T13:50:05Z	(#hsouiwa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> needlessly complicated and still has the exact same security vulnerabilities as web2 and it’s own security quirks that never seem to be front of mind 😅
2022-09-27T21:08:23Z	(#mlsmpia) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and people are trying to push for health care information on the blockchain in the form of NFTs. They truely don’t see how much of an awful idea this is
2023-01-31T00:57:59Z	👋 Sheesh! I’ve been gone for a good while. Lots of stuff going on between work, new sleep schedule for the kiddo and other personal things. How’s everyone going over here?
2023-01-31T01:49:24Z	(#dmpg2ba) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> agreed! I’m 100% keen for this. Will need to link up over Signal to discuss details.  Consulting life certainly is tougher and more cut throat than I initially expected 😅
2023-01-31T10:36:17Z	Out of interest, anyone use a secure IRC client for iOS? Ideally E2EE, but open to suggestions. I figure just going to the App Store and finding the first client may be…risky
2023-02-01T02:20:29Z	I posted up a new discussion about the current filter menu on mobile. Keen to hear everyone's thoughts and even further suggestions :)  https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/1129
2023-02-01T02:58:57Z	(#47ahtla) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> thanks for the perspective 😀  I’m usually a big fan of the fly in/out but perhaps the duration is too long, or not even necessary for good web design 🤔
2023-02-01T05:46:21Z	(#47ahtla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Glad you like it. I’ll refine the look and feel of it tomorrow morning then 😊
2023-02-06T23:32:48Z	(#xjpvgoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> how’s the readability, minus the issues with spacing? Genuinely interested to see if this is a meaningful improvement on current fonts
2023-02-07T03:16:55Z	(#xjpvgoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> 😆it’s only early days. Maybe you’re view will change over time! /s  The spaces are definitely too much for me to realistically use. A cool thought exercise around accessibility features for websites though!  Side note: a cool little connection between this and a govt. org. My brother-in-law actually works for a govt. org that audits Australian websites for accessibility and assigns then a score 😄
2023-02-07T20:25:29Z	Recently, for the first time ever, I decided to give dual booting a try. It’s actually been working really well. I use Parrot OS (Home Edition) for daily use and Windows 11 for all of my gaming needs. Eventually, I’d like to back up just my games and format all of my storage so I can start those off fresh.  I must say, using a Linux OS as my daily driver OS has been super fun and useful, considering I don’t have to spin up a VM or WLS whenever I want to do some form of sysadmin work (I’m much more comfortable in a Unix terminal than Windows 😅)
2023-02-07T22:17:45Z	(#qlh77ja) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Oh no, the whole preferred shell thing is a plus, but I split them into 2 different applications: Windows for gaming and Parrot OS for everything else.
2023-02-09T05:21:21Z	(#fjtdvda) I should be available to attend at 0500 UTC! That would be 3pm AEST, correct?  Also, for those who can’t attend, is there a view to take and provide minutes? If no, I’d be more than happy to do so (75% of my job in meetings at work 😂)
2023-02-10T02:40:45Z	(#fjtdvda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I got you! I’ll only be able to attend the 0500 UTC one though

2023-02-13T08:44:55Z	(#zmcotpa) @<eldersnake https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I’ve personally been using screen for the better part of 5 years. I tried to get into tmux shortly before that, but didn’t quite understand it (to be fair, I never really put the effort in)  Is tmux worth potentially switching?
2023-02-15T04:08:39Z	(#gz5euha) My view is, if we ever get to a point that a true “AI” can be created, something that can entirely learn new concepts by itself and exponentially expand it’s own knowledge base without being told to do so (basically what I would consider sentient at that point), humans won’t know about it until it’s significantly too late to stop it. I think that’s where the general hysteria comes from, but for now I’ll use these LLMs to spit out lists of cyber security controls to make my work _that_ little bit easier
2023-02-16T01:44:31Z	(#jm3kkrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hmmm, once I finalise the filter menu, I think I have my next project: try to design and nice UI/UX. I haven’t really done anything to the scale before but I’m keen to have a go!
2023-02-16T06:47:58Z	(#jm3kkrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I’ll scope out MithrilJS and reach out if I need any help (my JS skills aren’t anything special 😂)
2023-02-16T21:07:39Z	Submitting a client document, that I worked on by myself, for first internal review today. Wish me luck 🤞😬
2023-02-17T02:46:48Z	(#m7e43rq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thanks!  Update: went pretty well, just mostly small adjustments and a re-review by the manager, then it’s off to the Director for round 2 of 3 internal review rounds
2023-02-21T09:12:42Z	(#7nfewkq) @<eldersnake https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> a button having a default type of “button”?! That’s insanity!!!! What next, `<a>` having the default behaviour of a link?! /s  At least it’s good to know that buttons have a default type of submit, even if it’s a dumb decision
2023-02-21T09:16:33Z	(#2p5jzrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> sounds like we need to…captcha the bots 😅
2023-02-28T01:50:17Z	(#s6wx52a) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> all hail the motherland 🫡  Congrats! The Kingdom welcomes you with open arms!!!
2023-02-28T01:51:17Z	Resurfacing after being enthralled in games for a while. How’s everything going?
2023-02-28T03:13:22Z	(#uirjkca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hopefully not just work related 😆 My weekends have been packed recently. Looking forward to just relaxing
2023-02-28T10:39:49Z	Oof. I would usually go straight to sleep after putting the little one to sleep but here I am, awake and twting. Time to do one of the many things on my list to make me feel like I’m accomplishing something with my spare time
2023-02-28T10:55:06Z	(#emxpkzq) Target acquired!  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/jdCVHuphRjZ6DgdiF4Farj.png)
2023-02-28T11:54:10Z	(#emxpkzq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Just further learning for my desired job (DFIR role). Learning some python so I can provide more value for clients 😊
2023-02-28T21:31:00Z	(#emxpkzq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> 😂 I will. I’m needing to add html as well because it’s a full re-design and doing that all in browser is proving to be a pain (work effectively can’t be saved)
2023-02-28T23:48:57Z	(#mcpw62q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I wonder if the MPA is just mad at Paramount and is being petty by taking down services that make it easier to find shows and tv shows.
2023-03-01T04:49:55Z	(#7ycjsea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> bit of an edge case but depending on the number of emails you’re getting for a password reset, they could be doing a widespread attack to cause notification fatigue for when they send out mass phishing emails.  In reality, this attack would look like: Attacker uses a script to cycle password resets -> user gets fatigued due to number of password reset emails -> phishing email sent -> user uses malicious link and form to provide the attacker with their credentials.  If you’re only getting a couple of these, probably not but could also be spread across weeks or months of 1 per day. I personally haven’t seen this attack in practice, but could be a possibility
2023-03-02T20:49:19Z	(#lvxokqa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> thanks! It’s fun to think outside of the box sometimes 😉
2023-03-02T22:21:13Z	Goals for this weekend: - Stand up a Parrot OS Architect VM. - Create a dev environment of yarn. - Commence actual work on new filter option. - Finish my future-state home network diagram (for when I move in 20 days)  Should be a productive weekend 😁
2023-03-03T11:59:47Z	(#bn6egua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Sure! I'd be keen to have a look 😊
2023-03-03T22:51:12Z	Got an open home today, for 15 mins. Should be fun 😅  Moving by the end of the month to much nicer house (not a townhouse, hooray!), so very excited for that.
2023-03-04T00:24:18Z	(#cdw7gsa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Renting still. Will at minimum need to wait for the market to come down to buy haha
2023-03-04T06:14:03Z	Thoughts on the filter menu being in this position? Other idea I had was along side the search field at the top.  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/nzjQnVEKsFiWqXwTTps4ZN.mp4)
2023-03-04T06:25:33Z	(#jm3kkrq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> oh my, I didn't even see this as a question to me for some reason :S  No solid plans for now, but will have a better think when I get to it :P This will be for the web version
2023-03-07T08:02:52Z	(#yy2couq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  funnily enough, I was going to ask about support for moderator roles a while ago…then I forgot 😂
2023-03-07T08:04:49Z	Today was an interesting day. Following a suggestion (based on my skills and want to move to a more technical role) my leadership is now chasing a SOC analyst role for me. Bonus: the Director of our SOC wants me in there and they’re super nice 😊
2023-03-07T08:06:16Z	(#byqgxsq) Side note: the iOS app doesn’t auto capitalise at the start of a twt or after a full stop (period for you Americans out there)
2023-03-07T13:59:57Z	(#yy2couq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> could be interesting food for thought down the track if a pod grows big enough
2023-03-08T08:04:02Z	(#byqgxsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thanks! 😊🙏
2023-03-08T08:05:57Z	(#yy2couq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yeah, I can understand that. I was more thinking from the POV of lightening the load of the operators in terms of support and potential account removals without having full blown operator permissions, but I can understand if that’s not the intention of the use of yarn
2023-03-15T01:53:26Z	Morning yarn: I certainly enjoy putting together a body of work to teach Govt. the advantages and disadvantages of on-prem, Anything-as-a-Service and Managed Services 🙃
2023-03-15T02:05:46Z	(#trert6a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yarn bucks coming? Truely decentralised money to bring competition to banking? 😉😂
2023-03-16T00:19:10Z	(#hnqd5qq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> But it has a 4 at the end, so _surely_ it’s better than 3, right?!
2023-03-26T22:36:09Z	(#hg2azfa) It sure is morning 😴
2023-03-26T22:38:13Z	Last Friday, I had my first public speaking appearance, albeit internal but still spoke in front of 60+ people.  I thought I would crash and burn or run through this too quickly, but the audience made everything super easy. Never thought that public speaking would actually be somewhat of a strength of mine 😳  Moral of the story: get out of your comfort zone, you might discover something you’re good at and enjoy!
2023-03-26T22:48:15Z	(#q4esjxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Haha that would’ve have been worse! Honestly, it wasn’t easy at all. I was SUPER nervous and anxious throughout but I’ve had a lot of feedback that I came across as confident, relaxed, funny and felt natural. So there’s that 🤷😂
2023-03-26T22:50:23Z	(#hg2azfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ooooo I really like this update! I’ll have to update on my end and rollback my `.anchor { display: none; }`
2023-03-28T04:08:01Z	Been trying to get a `vultr.com` VPS up and running to host production websites on using `zs`.  The default Debian and Ubuntu headless offerings come with a very unfamiliar shell that I, for some reason, can’t properly install `zs` on so will need to explore options for custom ISOs of a Debian/Ubuntu distro to use. Probably the latest LTS versions, I’m thinking.
2023-03-28T07:18:20Z	(#ajdgkjq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yeah, I also did consider Docker. No real good reason not to. I’ll test this out tonight
2023-03-29T10:27:35Z	(#wpmivjq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> How did the presentation Go? 😂
2023-03-30T06:56:30Z	Welp, it’s official. Moving to a more technical role than I’m currently in, in a couple of weeks, in a Security Operations capacity
2023-04-04T07:53:35Z	(#r47kuyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<shreyan https://twtxt.net/user/shreyan/twtxt.txt>  this is part of my frustration with the regulatory conversation around TikTok right now. Sure, ban an app for “national security” reasons but US companies that harvest all data from everyone is totally fine.  The only compromise is to regulate all tracking and data harvesting.
2023-04-05T07:10:49Z	Anyone know of any good, cheap laptops to use for just day-to-day activities (web surfing, sysadmin, web design, etc) that’s not a Chromebook? My Microsoft Surface Go I got some years ago blue screens when I plug it into my dock.  Open to refurbished as well
2023-04-05T07:27:34Z	(#bxmk53q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> <$1000 AUD (am poor lol)
2023-04-05T07:47:15Z	(#bxmk53q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I really like the framework, especially the repair and upgradability of them. A tad out of my price range but I’ll ask the accountant if an exception can be made 😉  Otherwise I’ll go for the PineBook. Thank you for all the suggestions!
2023-04-05T08:25:18Z	(#bxmk53q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and within minutes 😂
2023-04-06T07:04:28Z	Well, that’s a wrap! Officially finished my last day of cyber security governance, risk management and compliance!  Ready to get started on the blue team next week!!!
2023-04-08T08:50:56Z	(#hi4fjoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> damn, that’s rough. Was trying to get zs and my yarn node up and running on my vultr VPS last night.  Oh well! Hope you holiday was fun anyways!
2023-04-17T08:02:36Z	When you see a domain admin account signed into an iPad for a client and it’s out of scope to mention to them 🫠
2023-04-19T04:14:40Z	(#aulvgyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> if only I was allowed 😂
2023-12-23T06:08:45Z	👋 Happy Holidays from above the clouds!  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/d6FbB8FDzyrPduJWC8uz7d.png)
2023-12-23T06:26:50Z	(#6xxfoeq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thanks mate! You too! Hope the family has a great Xmas as well
2023-12-23T06:35:02Z	Anyone have a good way of sneaking out 2 server racks, one with 2x 1U servers, out of work?! Asking for a friend 😆  On a serious note: I need to find out who to ask about abandoned server racks and servers at work. No ones used them in upwards of 6 months and I’m the only person with access to the room they’re stored in 🤔
2023-12-23T11:51:31Z	(#2zzml5q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I was thinking of doing this with a getaway drive on standby. It’s a long elevator ride down though 😂
2023-12-28T14:01:06Z	(#z33bzjq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<eldersnake https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> ah yes, the old anal beads cheating then defecating in a bathtub. A classic, really 😂
2023-12-28T15:58:55Z	(#z33bzjq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> minus the defecating part, Hans Niemann was also accused of cheating via anal beads by Grand Masters. Bit of a classic accusation emerging 😂  https://www.npr.org/2023/09/26/1201734274/chess-hans-niemann-anal-beads-cheating
2023-12-29T01:19:27Z	(#rskibqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Congrats! 🥳 FTTP has really been night and day in terms of speed since moving over to the East.
2024-01-04T10:00:54Z	Big win today!  I've only been exposed to using Kusto Query Language (KQL) at work for a month and a half, but I was able to edit a query to include a datatable (essentially a table that's created in memory when you run the query and is only used for that query) to replace any IDs listed in it with the proper name of the service!  Baby steps :)
2024-01-05T02:14:13Z	(#vyp5qoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> wow…  I really don’t see the train of thought of making something so simple to implement (specifically SSO) a paid “enterprise” feature to justify a price point.  Hell, I could probably implement the feature in a couple of hours and I have very limited development experience 😅  They could also re-evaluate the price point then add more features to the paid plan (that ideally add much more value than SSO) and then raising the price when it makes sense to. So many companies do this right now anyway.  On the whole paid features for self-hosting, I ran into this issue myself when implementing a SIEM on my network. I initially implemented the Elastic stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) but then they go ahead and lock things like creating detection rules and sending alerts via anything other than email a paid feature 🫠  I’d be much happier if the industry switched to a one time self-hosting service with no support, with the option to purchase support licenses at a monthly cost.
